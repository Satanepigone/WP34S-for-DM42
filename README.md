# SDKdemo


## This repo contains the sources for SDK demo project - simple scientific RPN calculator

- There is DMCP interface doc in progress see [DMCP IFC doc](http://technical.swissmicros.com/dmcp/doc/DMCP-ifc-html/) (or
you can download html zip from [doc directory](http://technical.swissmicros.com/dmcp/doc/)).


README file contains basic instructions how to prepare building environment and build the program.

For the basic SDK with simple 'Hello World!' program look at DMCP_SDK repository.

You can look at this SDKdemo project for more advanced project with
keyboard handling, more sophisticated LCD printing, power management, build with Intel® Decimal
Floating-Point Math Library, user defined menus and more.

For ultimate project which uses other aspect of the DMCP system (like system timers, bitmap printing
to LCD or printing to IR printer) look at sources of the DM42PGM project.

At this time the only source of information about the use of DMCP system interface is based on
the source code of DMCP programs.
