    <h2 id="Intro">About this program</h2>
    This program is a port of the WP&nbsp;34S calculator to the DM42 platform.
    <br>
    It includes much of the original WP&nbsp;34S code with some changes and extensions.
    <br>
    All of the original calculator's standard features are supported,
    along with the
    <a href="#Stopwatch">stopwatch</a>,
    <a href="#Print">IR printing</a>,
    <a href="#CLMode">complex lock mode</a>,
    <a href="#ERPN">entry RPN</a>,
    <a href="#Files">extended file handling</a>,
    and <a href="#UDmenus">user-defined menus</a>.
    <br>
    As on the original calculator the calculator state occupies
    2kB. The library space for user programs is 16kB 
    (i.e., 8k program steps).
    <br>
    There are three versions of the program which differ only in their displays
    (see the file README.md for details). Everything that follows
    applies to all three versions. 

    <h2 id="S_or_C">WP&nbsp;34S or WP&nbsp;34C?</h2>
    On the original calculator, the WP&nbsp;34C was a version of the WP&nbsp;34S
    with added code (complex lock mode) to make it easier to
    work with complex numbers.
    <br>
    To make room for this extra code, some of the features of the
    WP&nbsp;34S had to be omitted.
    <br>
    Two program steps were taken up with flags used by the extra code.
    <br>
    On the DM42 there is plenty of memory for everything and so rather
    than having two separate versions, I have included 
    <a href="#CLMode">complex lock mode</a>
    as part of the WP&nbsp;34S.
    <br>
    This will not affect you if you never use it.
    <br>
    The two program steps are no longer needed!
    
    
    <h2 id="Leave"><b>Exiting the program</b></h2>
    If you just want to turn the calculator off, press
    <span class="button">SHIFT</span> <span class="button">EXIT</span>&nbsp;.
    <br>
    To get back to the DMCP menu (e.g., in order to reload the 
    Free42 firmware):
    <ul>
      <li>Press <span class="button">SHIFT</span> <span class="button">0</span>&nbsp;. This
      brings up the SETUP menu.</li> 
      <li>Press <span class="button">F1</span> (EXIT).</li>
      <li>You can then use <span class="lcd">3: Load Program</span> to choose a
	different firmware file to load, or <span class="lcd">2: Run Program</span>
	to return to the already-loaded WP&nbsp;34S.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Notation">Notation</h2>
    In what follows, 
    <ul>
      <li><span class="button">TAN</span> means the button labelled
	TAN;</li>
      <li><span class="button">f</span> <span class="button">TAN</span>
      means one press of the shift key, followed by the button
	labelled TAN. This may also be shown as
	<span class="button">f</span> <span class="button">ATAN</span>&nbsp;.</li>
      <li><span class="button">g</span> <span class="button">TAN</span>
      means two presses of the shift key, followed by the button
	labelled TAN. Where appropriate, this may also be shown as
	<span class="button">g</span> <span class="button">ATAN</span>&nbsp;.</li>
      <li><span class="lcd">HELP</span> means the menu button
	labelled HELP on the screen. This may also
	be shown as <span class="button">F2</span>&nbsp;, where F2 means the
	second menu key counting from the left.</li>
      <li>This <span class="lcd">style</span> is also used to show
      any displayed text or numbers.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="Keyboard">Keyboard and Shift states</h2>
    DM42 keys are mapped so that wherever possible, they do what they
    say.
    <br>
    For example,
    the <span class="button">TAN</span> key computes the tangent of an
    angle; <span class="button">f</span> <span class="button">TAN</span> computes
    the inverse tangent; in alpha mode it enters L, l, lambda, etc.
    <br>
    The WP&nbsp;34S <span class="button">&rarr;</span>
    and <span class="button">CPX</span> keys are provided in this
    program by the keys <span class="button">F5</span>
    and <span class="button">F6</span>&nbsp;.
    <br>
    Outside of alpha mode there are two
    shift states: <span class="button">f</span> (one press of
    <span class="button">SHIFT</span>&nbsp;)
    and <span class="button">g</span> (two presses). A third
    press cancels the shift. 
    <br>
    In alpha mode there is a third shift
    state <span class="button">h</span>&nbsp;, invoked by pressing
    <span class="button">SHIFT</span> three times. 

    <h2 id="Display">Annunciators</h2>
    The names and meanings of some annunciators have been changed from
    those on the original calculator.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>INPUT is now <span class="lcd">ALPHA</span>&nbsp;; this shows ALPHA mode.</li>
      <li>The down arrow <span class="lcd">↓</span> still means
      lower case in ALPHA mode.</li> 
      <li>BEG is now either <span class="lcd">S:4</span>
	or <span class="lcd">S:8</span>&nbsp;, depending on the stack 
	size.</li>
      <li>360 is now <span class="lcd">DEG</span>&nbsp;, showing degrees mode.</li>
      <li>The little <span class="lcd">=</span> sign is now used to show complex lock mode
	<span class="lcd">C_LK</span>&nbsp;.
	Outside of complex lock mode <span class="lcd">=</span> flashes when the
	stopwatch is running.</li>
      <li>STO is now <span class="lcd">PGM</span>&nbsp;, showing program
      entry (Learn) mode.</li>
      <li><span class="lcd">RPN</span>
      becomes <span class="lcd">eRPN</span> in entry RPN mode.</li> 
      <li>RCL is now <span class="lcd">RUN</span>&nbsp;, to show that a program is running. This
	annunciator does not flash.</li>
      <li>There is a new annunciator <span class="lcd">PRT</span>
	which indicates that the
	printing commands are enabled.</li>
    </ul>    

    <h2 id="Menus">Menus</h2>
    Menus use the top row of function keys, unshifted and f-shifted, to
    provide the full set of WP&nbsp;34S keyboard functions along with some
    extras.
    <br>
    Almost every menu has the
    <span class="lcd">→</span> and <span class="lcd">CPX</span>
    functions on unshifted <span class="button">F5</span>
    and <span class="button">F6</span>&nbsp;. 
    <ul>
      <li>Calling the same menu twice brings up the <i>default menu</i>.</li>
      <li>The default menu can also be reached by pressing
	<span class="button">f</span> <span class="button">ASSIGN</span>&nbsp;.</li>
      <li>Initially the default menu displays only
	<span class="lcd">→</span>
	and <span class="lcd">CPX</span> keys.</li>
      <li>Pressing <span class="button">f</span> <span class="button">ASSIGN</span>
      when the default menu is displayed toggles between this version
	and one that includes
	<span class="lcd">Σ+</span>&nbsp;,
	<span class="lcd">1/x</span>&nbsp;,
	<span class="lcd">√</span>&nbsp;, and
	<span class="lcd">LOG</span>&nbsp;, which is helpful when labels
	A-D are assigned to these keys.</li> 
      <li>Pressing
	<span class="button">SHIFT</span>-hold-<span class="button">&#9650;</span>
	goes to the previous menu.</li>
    </ul>
    Most menus are on f-shifted keys; a few are on g-shifted keys.
    <br>
    See the sections on
    <a href="#Alpha">Alpha mode</a> and
    <a href="#CLMode">Complex Lock mode</a> for menus in
    these modes.

    </ul>

    <h2 id="Cats">Accessing catalogues</h2>
    The WP&nbsp;34S makes most of its functions available via catalogues. This
    is where to find them.

    <h2 id="Unshift">Unshifted keys</h2>
    These all do much what you would expect from their labels.
    <br>
    The four
    keys <span class="button">&Sigma;+</span>&nbsp;,
    <span class="button">1/x</span>&nbsp;,
    <span class="button">√x</span>&nbsp;,
    and <span class="button">LOG</span> on the top row run code
    starting from labels
    A, B, C, and D if defined in the current program. The normal 
    functions of the keys are always available via
    <span class="button">g</span>&nbsp;.
    <br>
    The Arrow key <span class="button">F5</span> brings up a temporary
    menu. Choosing a base from this menu gives a 
    temporary display of the x-register in that base; choosing an angular
    unit converts from the current angular mode to that unit. Conversion
    to and from HMS is also possible.

    <h2 id="Fshift">f-shifted keys</h2>
    Like the unshifted keys, these do what their labels say or at least something closely
    related.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="button">COMPLEX</span> - outside of complex
      lock mode, same function as the CPX key.
	<span class="button">F6</span>&nbsp;.</li>
      <li><span class="button">LASTx</span> - does RCL L, which is how Last
	X works on the WP&nbsp;34S.</li>

      <li><span class="button">CATALOG</span> - the CAT catalogue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Gshift">g-shifted keys</h2>
    As with the unshifted keys, these do what their keylabels say, or
    at least something closely related.
    <ul>
      <li><span class="button">g</span>
	<span class="button">&Sigma;+</span>&nbsp;, <span class="button">1/x</span>&nbsp;,
	<span class="button">√</span>&nbsp;,

      <li><span class="button">g</span>
	<span class="button">+</span> - STATUS (CATALOGUE).</li>  
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Alpha">Alpha mode</h2>
    Alpha mode is entered and exited via <span class="button">f</span>
    <span class="button">ENTER</span> (ALPHA).
    <br>
    The letters and symbols to the right of the keys on the DM42
    keyboard produce the 
    corresponding letters in alpha mode. This difference carries over to the
    Greek letters - for example, Greek lambda is accessed from
    the <span class="button">TAN</span> key (L) rather than
    the <span class="button">E</span> key (exponent) (which is L on
    the WP&nbsp;34S). 
    <br>
    With the exception of the letters and their Greek analogues, I
    believe that alpha mode works in the same way as on the real 
    WP&nbsp;34S in the sense that the same <b>key positions</b> give the same
    characters.
    <ul>
      <li>h-shift (3 presses of the shift key) is used in alpha
	mode.</li>
      <li>The alpha catalogues are accessed from the same keyboard
	positions and shift states as on the real calculator. You are strongly
	advised to read the WP&nbsp;34S manual!</li>
      <li>Note that the alpha catalogues found on

	<span class="button">&rarr;</span>
	and
	<span class="button">f</span>

    <h2 id="Files">Working with files</h2>
    The memory of the original WP&nbsp;34S included 2kB of RAM for the
    calculator state and 128kB of flash memory.
    <br>
    The firmware filled most of the
    flash. Of the remainder, 2kB was used as a backup region for the
    calculator state and what was left - the library - could store user programs.
    <br>
    Note that programs in the backup region or in the library can be run <b>without</b>
    loading them into the 2kB calculator state.
    <br>
    This program stores the calculator state (2kB), the backup region (2kB) and the
    library (16kB) in RAM rather than in flash memory.
    <br>
    The contents of RAM on the DM42 are permanent until
    the WP&nbsp;34S program is exited (e.g., to re-load Free42); it even
    survives battery replacement.
    <br>In particular, RAM persists when the calculator is turned off and on.
    <br>
    To provide storage that survives even when the firmware is exited,
    the calculator state, the backup region, and the library are
    written to a set of files. These files live in
    wp34s/ which is created automatically if it doesn't exist. 
    <br>
    The files are:
    <ul>
      <li><b>wp34s.dat</b> - an image of the calculator's state. Since
	the RAM contents survive when the calculator is turned off, this
	is only written when the EXIT button in the Setup
	menu is pressed.</li> 
      <li><b>wp34s-backup.dat</b> - in the Setup menu
	the
	function <span class="lcd">OnSTO</span>
	writes a copy of the calculator's state to the backup region
	and also to this file. (On 
	the original WP&nbsp;34S pressing "On" and "STO" together had the same
	function.)
	<br>
	The function <span class="lcd">OnRCL</span> from the same
	menu restores RAM from the backup.</li>
      <li><b>wp34s-lib.dat</b> - the functions <span class="lcd">PSTO</span>
	and <span class="lcd">PRCL</span> in the P.FCN
	catalogue read and write the current program to and from the
	library. When this happens, this library file is updated too.</li>
    </ul>
    When the calculator is switched off and on, no files are written
    or read.
    <br>
    But when the WP&nbsp;34S firmware is
    loaded or run from the DMCP menu (options 3 and 2) the state,
    backup, and library regions are 
    reloaded from these three files.
    <br>
    The other commands in the Setup and Setup 2 menus are:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="lcd">EXIT</span> - exits to the DMCP
	menu. Saves the calculator state.</li>
      <li><span class="lcd">System</span> - access the System menu,
	activate USB disk, About.</li>
      <li><span class="lcd">HELP</span> - opens this file.</li>
      <li><span class="lcd">SvRAM</span> (Save RAM) - writes a copy of
	the calculator state
	to a named file (with a .dat 
	extension).</li>
      <li><span class="lcd">LdRAM</span> (Load RAM) - loads a named file
	(with a .dat extension) into 
	the calculator state.</li>
      <li><span class="lcd">SvLib</span> (Save Library) - writes a copy of
	the library region to a named file (with a .lib extension).</li> 
      <li><span class="lcd">LdLib</span> (Load Library) - loads a named file
	(with a .lib extension) 
	into the library region. This overwrites any programs already stored.</li>
      <li><span class="lcd">SvCPRG</span> (Save current program) - writes a
	copy of the current program 
	to a named file. Note that the current program must begin
	with a global label (i.e., LBL'A' or LBL'CAT', not LBL A or
	LBL 01).</li>
      <li><span class="lcd">LdPRG</span> (Load program) - load a named
	program file into the flash region, from 
	where it can be added to the calculator state for editing with
	the PRCL command.</li>
    </ul>
    IMPORTANT: The library and program files are not human-readable. They
    contain the opcodes that make up the program or the library, along
    with size and checksum information.
    <br>
    To make them human-readable you
    need to disassemble them with the tremendously versatile WP&nbsp;34S
    assembler suite of tools.
    <br>
    If you want the files to be portable to 
    other systems, this is vital: the op-codes in the WP&nbsp;34S can change when
    the number of commands alters, making the files partially or
    completely unreadable.
    <br>
    The correct opcodes for this system are found in the file
    src/tools/wp34s.op, along with the assembler.
    <br>
    Not only are the disassembled files
    human-readable, they can be re-assembled correctly when the op-codes change.
    <br>
    Transferring files as source listings is the
    only reliable way to get them from one WP&nbsp;34S system to another,
    unless both use the same op-codes.

    <h2 id="Print">IR Printing</h2>
    This program allows printing to an HP-82240A or B printer via the
    DM42's IR hardware. (Print mode 0 may not work on the HP-82240A.)
    <br>
    The commands behave as documented in the WP&nbsp;34S manual, except as
    mentioned below. Note that <span class="lcd">P.</span> represents
    the printer icon.
    <br>
    Many commands are found in the PRINT
    menu, <span class="button">f</span> <span class="button">PRINT</span>&nbsp;.
    <ul>
      <li><span class="lcd">P.ON</span> and <span class="lcd">P.OFF</span>
	enable and disable printing.</li>
      <li><span class="lcd">P.DblSp</span> takes an argument: 1 turns on
	double line spacing, 0 turns it off.</li>
      <li><span class="lcd">P.Mode</span> can be 0 (use printer characters
	where possible), 1 (WP&nbsp;34S
	characters as graphics), or 2 (really small WP&nbsp;34S
	graphic characters). Mode 3 (Serial) is not supported.</li>
      <li><span class="lcd">P.Stk</span> and <span class="lcd">P.Regs</span>
	print the stack and a block of registers. Prefixed by
	CPX, they format the register contents as complex numbers.</li>
      <li>In complex lock mode
	<span class="lcd">P.Stk</span> and <span class="lcd">P.Regs</span>
	print in complex form automatically. They also respect the RECT or
	POLAR display mode setting.</li>
    </ul>
    Printing commands not in this menu can be found in the
    catalogues.
    <br>
    Note that the pixel plotting commands are not (yet) implemented.

    <h2 id="Stopwatch">The stopwatch</h2>
    The stopwatch can be activated with the command
    <span class="lcd">STOPW</span> in the X.FCN
    catalogue.
    <br>
    If you use it frequently, adding it to a
    <a href="#UDmenus">user-defined menu</a> might
    be helpful.
    <br>
    All the stopwatch commands in the WP&nbsp;34S manual work as described.
    <br>
    When the stopwatch is running, the <span class="lcd">=</span>
    annunciator blinks.
    <br>
    The stopwatch here uses the real-time clock. This
    means that switching the calculator off has no effect on it, as
    the real-time clock runs continuously.
    <br>
    With the running stopwatch displayed, the calculator will not
    switch off automatically.
    <br>
    With the stopwatch "running" in the background, the calculator will
    switch off in the usual way.

    <h2 id="UDmenus">User-defined menus</h2>
    The menus in the program are a necessity, but have also proved to
    be a virtue. I find the "program" menu
    <span class="button">g</span> <span class="button">PGRM</span> particularly
    convenient, and others agree.
    <br>
    Because of this, the system allows you to define your own
    user-defined menus. These can contain any WP&nbsp;34S command that can
    be entered as a program step.
    <br>
    The idea is to write a program containing the commands you want in
    your menu. This program must start with a global label.
    <br>
    Then the command <span class="lcd">UMEN</span>
    (found in the menu
    <span class="button">g</span> <span class="button">CUSTOM</span>&nbsp;)
    takes the label as an argument and displays the menu.
    <br>
    The functions <span class="lcd">UM1</span>&nbsp;, ...,
    <span class="lcd">UM6</span> provide quick access to menus labelled UM1, ..., UM6.
    <br>
    <span class="button">f</span> <span class="button">CUSTOM</span>
    returns to the current user menu.
    <br>
    For more details please see the documentation in /help on the
    gitlab site.

    <h2 id="ERPN">Entry RPN</h2>
    Normally, typing
    <span class="button">2</span> <span class="button">ENTER</span>
    puts 2 in the X and Y registers, and
    pushes the top register off the stack.
    <br>
    In Entry RPN mode, typing
    <span class="button">2</span> <span class="button">ENTER</span>
    puts 2 in the X register and
    leaves the rest of the stack unchanged.
    <br>
    If this is for you, you can enable or disable Entry RPN mode with
    the commands <span class="lcd">eRPon</span> and
    <span class="lcd">eRPoff</span>&nbsp;, found in the
    <span class="button">g</span> <span class="button">MODES</span> menu.
    <br>
    More details in the documentation in /help.

    <h2 id="CLMode">Complex Lock Mode</h2>
    The WP&nbsp;34S offers excellent support for complex numbers. Complex
    Lock mode aims to make the entry, display, and use of such numbers
    more straightforward.
    <br>
    For more details, refer to the documentation in /help. Only the
    basics are outlined below.
    <ul>
      <li>
	You must execute <span class="lcd">CPXYES</span> in the
	<span class="button">MODE</span> catalogue before you can enter complex
	lock mode.</li>
      <li>
	Having done this, pressing <span class="lcd">&rarr;</span>
	<span class="lcd">CPX</span> enters complex lock
	mode. The C_LK menu is then displayed.
      </li>
      <li>
	To enter the number (2+3i), type
	<span class="button">2</span> <span class="lcd">CPX</span>
	<span class="button">3</span> <span class="button">ENTER</span>&nbsp;.
	Note the helpful prompts.
      </li>
      <li>
	Pressing <span class="button">x<sup>2</sup></span>
	will square this number without the need to
	press the <span class="lcd">CPX</span> key.
	In complex lock mode, functions act on complex
	numbers by default.
      </li>
      <li>
	Now press <span class="lcd">POLAR</span> from the C_LK menu.
	This displays the result in polar
	form.
      </li>
      <li>
	Now, pressing
	<span class="button">4</span> <span class="lcd">CPX</span>
	<span class="button">4</span> <span class="button">5</span>
	<span class="button">/</span> will divide the result by the complex
	number with modulus 4 and argument 45. Again, note the helpful
	prompts.
      </li>
      <li>
	You can exit complex lock mode by pressing
	<span class="lcd">&rarr;</span> <span class="lcd">CPX</span>&nbsp;. If you will
	not be returning you can execute <span class="lcd">CPXNO</span>&nbsp;.
      </li>
    </ul>
    In C_LK mode, some menus are modified or completely absent. There
    are no programming functions, statistics, matrix, or integer
    commands. This is a limitation, but it hasn't proved a problem in
    the past.
